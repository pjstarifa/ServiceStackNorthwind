# ServiceModel.Types

1. The base classes are built using a T4 template called OrmLite.Poco.tt
1. The results are placed in OrmLite.Poco1.cs
1. For some reason I can't get the above added to the project
1. The only other class used in the types folder is CustomerOrders.cs
1. OrmLite.Core1.cs is empty
1. Need to investigate and tidy up
